Here you will find a list of everyone I have to thank for contributing code,
suggestions, comments, other feedback, or anything else that was useful to the
library. This file never shrinks - if a name goes missing, it's because a chat
handle was replaced by a real name. There is no significance to the order.

Thanks to:

Tony Van Eerd
Ben Alex
Simon Stienen
Alexander Buddenbrock
