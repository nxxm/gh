## Motivation
http[s] queries made easy for C++ developer.

We deliver here an easy to use and reuse library to perform all possible HTTP 1.1 communications. 

This a pure modern C++ library, not just a wrapper around C cURL, which is available on all imaginable platforms where C++ is.

  * Dependencies shipped: [we auto-satisfy them](https://github.com/header-only/inglued).
  * [Extremely cross-platform](doc/supported_platforms.md) : Native or WebAssembly.
  * Performant \& Fast to setup \& learn
